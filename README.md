# Arduino-Based Heart Beat Sensor

This project is an Arduino-based heart rate monitor that uses a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to measure heart rate. The system processes the PPG signal to calculate and display the heart rate in real-time.

## Code Overview

The Python code provided simulates the PPG data acquisition and processing. In a real implementation, the PPG sensor would be connected to an Arduino, which would send the data to a computer for processing.

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arduino-heart-beat-sensor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to project directory:
    ```cd arduino-heart-beat-sensor
    ```
3. Run the Python script:
    ```python heart_rate_monitor.py
    ```
