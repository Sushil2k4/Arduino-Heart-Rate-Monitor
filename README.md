## Introduction

Heart rate monitoring is a crucial aspect of understanding cardiovascular health and physical performance. Traditional methods often require expensive medical-grade equipment, making them inaccessible for everyday use. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a **low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use heart rate monitor** that can be used by individuals, athletes, and healthcare professionals alike.

The system uses a **PPG sensor** to detect blood volume changes in the skin, processes the data using an **Arduino microcontroller**, and displays the heart rate in real-time using a **Python-based application**.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup
1. Connect the PPG sensor to the Arduino:
   - **VCC** ‚Üí 5V on Arduino
   - **GND** ‚Üí GND on Arduino
   - **Signal** ‚Üí A0 on Arduino
2. Upload the Arduino code (`heart_rate_sensor.ino`) to the Arduino.

### 2. Software Setup
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Update the serial port in heart_rate_monitor.py to match your Arduino's port (e.g., COM3 or /dev/ttyUSB0).

3. Run the Project
    Open the Arduino IDE and ensure the PPG sensor is sending data.

    Run the Python script:
        ```bash
        python heart_rate_monitor.py
        ```
    View the real-time heart rate in the console or GUI.

# How It Works
## Data Acquisition:
The PPG sensor detects blood volume changes in the skin and sends analog signals to the Arduino.

## Signal Processing: 
The Arduino converts the analog signal to digital and sends it to the computer via serial communication.

## Heart Rate Calculation: 
The Python script processes the PPG data, filters noise, detects peaks, and calculates the heart rate.

## Real-Time Display: 
The heart rate is displayed in real-time on the console or a graphical interface.

# Code Overview
### Arduino Code (arduino/heart_rate_sensor.ino)
 Reads PPG sensor data from analog pin A0.

Sends the data to the computer via serial communication.

### Python Code (python/heart_rate_monitor.py)
Receives PPG data from the Arduino.

Processes the data to calculate heart rate.

Displays the heart rate in real-time.
